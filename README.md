# Community-Page
# About Us
Okota Devs started as a community of budding developers from #ALCwithGoogle3.0 Okota meet-ups that carried on as a group in building their software development careers after #GoogleAfricaScholarship 2018 ended.
Okota Devs currently number in around a dozen and have regular online group discussions to help each other with coding problems and ensure all members are aware of the latest opportunities in the software development ecosystem amongst other activities.
# Goals
Steadily build a community profile with an attached portfolio that members can use as a reference for their profiles/portfolio.



### Happy Coding ❤

May the Code be with you all ❤
